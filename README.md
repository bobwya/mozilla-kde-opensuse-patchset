# mozilla-kde-opensuse-patchset
Base Opensuse Mozilla KDE-support patches - extracted directly from Source OpenSUSE RPM files - stored in the **Tumbleweed mozilla Repository**:

 * [**mozilla/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/src**](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/mozilla/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/src/)

This simple repository is required, as Upstream is only offering very delayed releases (of the thunderbird / firefox KDE patchsets) at:

 * **https://github.com/openSUSE/firefox-maintenance**
 * **https://www.rosenauer.org/hg/mozilla**

These KDE dialog patches are used by the packages:

 * **mail-client/thunderbird[kde]**
 * **www-client/firefox[kde]**

from the [**::bobwya Gentoo Overlay**](https://github.com/bobwya/bobwya).
